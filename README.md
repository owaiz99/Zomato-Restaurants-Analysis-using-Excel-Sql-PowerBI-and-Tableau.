# Zomato-Restaurants-Analysis-using-Excel-Sql-PowerBI-and-Tableau.
Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis Project
This project involved analyzing Zomato restaurant data using advanced Excel functions and SQL queries, and creating interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau. The objectives of the project were:

Building a country map table
Building a calendar table using the column datekey and adding columns such as year, monthno, monthfullname, quarter(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4), yearmonth (YYYY-MMM), weekdayno, weekdayname, financialmonth (April = FM1, May= FM2 â€¦ March = FM12), and financial quarter (quarters based on financial month)
Finding the number of restaurants by city and country
Analyzing restaurant opening trends by year, quarter, and month
Counting restaurants by average ratings
Creating buckets for average price ranges and finding out how many restaurants fall in each bucket
Calculating the percentage of restaurants with table booking and online delivery options
Developing charts based on cuisines, city, ratings, and other relevant parameters
To achieve these objectives, the project used various advanced Excel functions such as VLOOKUP, PivotTables, and conditional formatting. SQL queries were executed to extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset. The resulting data was then used to create interactive dashboards using Power BI and Tableau, providing valuable insights into restaurant industry trends related to location, opening trends, ratings, and price ranges.

The project showcases the use of Excel, SQL, and dashboard tools such as Power BI and Tableau for data analysis and visualization, and provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about these tools and techniques.


Excel
To achieve the objectives of the Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis project, various advanced Excel functions were used, including:

SUMIFS and COUNTIFS functions to extract and count data based on specific criteria
PivotTables and PivotCharts to summarize and analyze data
Conditional formatting to highlight key insights in the data
Report connections to link multiple PivotTables and charts to a single slicer, allowing for dynamic filtering of the data
VLOOKUP and INDEX-MATCH functions to merge data from different tables
DATE and YEAR functions to extract information from date fields


SQL
To extract relevant data from the Zomato dataset, SQL queries were executed using the following keywords:

SELECT to retrieve data from specific columns
FROM to specify the table to retrieve data from
WHERE to filter data based on specific conditions
GROUP BY to group data based on specific columns
ORDER BY to sort data in ascending or descending order
HAVING to filter data based on aggregated values
Window functions, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK, to perform calculations on subsets of data
Date functions, such as DATEADD, DATEDIFF, and DATEPART, to extract information from date fields and perform date calculations


Power BI
To visualize and analyze the Zomato restaurant data, Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data modeling using relationships between tables and calculated columns
Measures and DAX formulas to perform calculations on the data
Visualizations such as tables, charts, and maps to display the data
Slicers and filters to enable dynamic filtering of the data
Drill-through functionality to navigate between different levels of detail in the data


Tableau
In addition to Power BI, Tableau was also used to create interactive dashboards for the Zomato restaurant data analysis project. The following features and functions were utilized:

Data blending to combine data from different tables
Calculated fields to perform calculations on the data
Dimensions and measures to organize and analyze the data
Visualizations such as maps, charts, and tables to display the data
Filters and parameters to enable dynamic filtering of the data
